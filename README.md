# Find-xml-tag-in-directory
Here is a script I wrote to find xml files in a directory with a certain tag name. I specifically needed this to extract certain images from PlantCLEF2015
dataset with a specific 'Content' tag.

Simply replace the 'String's within the code with your own data and use it to extract the values you want. I hope it helps someone.
